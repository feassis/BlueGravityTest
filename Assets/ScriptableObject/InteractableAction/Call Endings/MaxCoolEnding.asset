  endGameText: You leave the store feeling like the coolest person in town, heck,
    in the world! So cool that you could freeze a whole lake! In fact, so cool that
    you are actually freezing. You are engulfed by a rock of ice and thus, never
    gets to the party to show how cool and a safety hazard you are. Thousands of
    years later you are found by archaeologists, they think past people are way past
    cool
