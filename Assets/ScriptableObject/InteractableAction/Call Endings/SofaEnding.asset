  endGameText: "\u201CYou lay over the sofa to increase your reach, you can just
    feel the riches waiting for you. \r\nLaying your head on the oh so comfortable
    cushion you finally feel the metal cold touch of your awaiting fortune. \r\nPulling
    the coin out of its hiding place, more gold coins start to spring out of the
    inconspicuous furniture like a fountain of fortune! It feels like a dream! Because
    it actually is.\r\nSleeping soundly on the sofa, you lost the party and made
    the store owner very annoyed.\u201D\r\n"
