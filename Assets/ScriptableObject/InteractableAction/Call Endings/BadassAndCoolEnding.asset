  endGameText: Look at you! There is not a cooler person in this whole city! You
    arrive at the parry pointing fingers and doing trendy dances. Everyone wants
    to be friends with the most radical guy around! You prosper both professionally
    and financially from the networking you got at the party. Although in your twilight
    years, you find yourself surrounded by shallow bonds and riches that you use
    to fill the hollowness in your soul. Was it the right choice? Who knows. You
    were badass as heck tho.
