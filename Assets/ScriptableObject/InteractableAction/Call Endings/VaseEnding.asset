    come to the conclusion that such an expensive vessel could only be used to store
    unfathomable riches. \r\nWith all your might, you swing at the decoration breaking
    it in a thousand pieces but all you get is unfathomable debt to the store debt
    for breaking his beloved family heirloom.\r\nCompletely broke, you not only did
    not get to the party but also work part-time in the store to pay for your debt.\r\n"
